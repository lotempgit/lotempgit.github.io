    Perfect Day
    ===========
    Lou Reed


    [Intro]
    
    Em  Am
    Em  Am


    [Verse]

    Am      D
    Just a  perfect day
    G             C
    Drink Sangria in the park
    F               Dm
    And then later  when it gets dark
          Em
    We go home

    Am      D
    Just a  perfect day
    G             C
    Feed animals  in the zoo
    F           Dm
    Then later  a movie too
              Em
    And then  home


    [Chorus]

        C           F
    Oh  it's such a perfect day
    Em                        F
    I'm glad I spent it with  you
    C             G
        Oh such a perfect day
              Am      G       F
    You just  keep me hanging on
              Am      G       F
    You just  keep me hanging on


    [Verse]

    Am      D
    Just a  perfect day
    G            C
    Problems all left alone
    F           Dm
    Weekenders  on our own
              Em
    It's such fun
    Am      D
    Just a  perfect day
    G           C
    You made me forget myself
    F               Dm
    I thought I was someone else
            Em
    Someone good


    [Chorus]

        C           F
    Oh  it's such a perfect day
    Em                        F
    I'm glad I spent it with  you
    C             G
        Oh such a perfect day
              Am      G       F
    You just  keep me hanging on
              Am      G       F
    You just  keep me hanging on


    [Instrumental]

    Am  G F
    Am  G F
    Am  G F


    [Ending]

    Em              F         C
    You're going to reap just what you sow
    Em              F         C
    You're going to reap just what you sow
    Em              F         C
    You're going to reap just what you sow
    Em              F         C
    You're going to reap just what you sow

    Em  F C
    Em  F C
